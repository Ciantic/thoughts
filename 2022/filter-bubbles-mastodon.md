# Filter Bubbles are Mastodon's best feature

Mastodon instances are filter bubbles, and I think this is its best feature. Each instance can have its own block rules for individual accounts and against other instances. Local feed is also a filter bubble on its own, which can help to facilitate discussion among a group.

Mastodon empowers coherent groups to protect their community from hate speech and other forms of harassment. Filter bubbles have a bad rap, but I think they are valuable to keep up with healthy discussions.

Especially for minority groups, these features are extremely useful: By congregating on a single server it allows people of the group to crowdsource blocking lists. Practically it helps to filter out toxicity way better than any centralized instance could.

Twitter could have implemented this as well if it had a way to join a group. Groups could then block people, or block other groups and filter content on behalf of the group's users.
