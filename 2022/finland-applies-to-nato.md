# Finland applies to NATO

I have always been leaning politically to left, but pragmatic.

Regardless of this, I have thought that Finland would be in NATO already, if it's image weren't tainted by US and UK's meddling in middle east. Finally Finnish and Swedish NATO membership is getting reality and back-stabbing our fellow neighbors is over.

For some in Finland and Sweden, fact that we didn't belong to NATO was some sort of virtue. That virtue signaling was problematic to me, as the same time our neighbors Denmark, Norway, Iceland or Estonia already belonged to NATO. I didn't see myself as greater person than my fellow neighbors.

With Finnish and Swedish membership the Nordic and European defense cooperation is becoming official rather than presumption. We are ready to help our neighbors in need as they are willing to help us. Era of back-stabbing of our neighbors is over, finally.
